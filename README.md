## What is Ree6?
Ree6 is a all in one Discord Bot maintained mainly by Presti (Me).

## Why does Ree6 exists?
Ree6 has started as a alternativ to Mee6 since alot of features are hidden behind of a paywall and subscriptions.
And we wanted to provide a Discord Bot that doesn't hide anything behind a paywall or subscriptions.

## What can Ree6 do?
As of right now Ree6 has the ability to play Music freely from YouTube, Spotify and Soundcloud.
Aswell as the "default" moderation ability such as ban, kick etc., Ree6 also provides its own implemantion of the Audit-Logger.
We also provide a **open-Source** Webinterface, Twitch and Twitter Notification, a Leveling System, a public Rest-API and more!


## Upcoming Features:
- YouTube Notification
- 100% adjustable messages
